# Weather and Climate Glossary

## Temperature
- **Maximum temperature**: The highest temperature reached during a 24-hour period, typically in the afternoon.
- **Minimum temperature**: The lowest temperature reached during a 24-hour period, usually just before dawn.
- **Dew point**: The temperature at which air becomes saturated with moisture; related to humidity comfort.

## Relative Humidity
- **Relative humidity (RH)**: The amount of moisture in the air compared to the maximum it could hold at that temperature, expressed as a percentage.
- **Comfort ranges**: Most people find 30–60% RH comfortable. Below 30% can feel dry; above 60% can feel muggy.
- **High humidity** (e.g. >70%): Reduces evaporative cooling; temperatures feel warmer than the thermometer reads.
- **Low humidity** (e.g. <30%): Can cause dry skin and respiratory irritation; temperatures may feel cooler.

## Interpretation Tips
- When both temperature and humidity are high, the "feels like" (heat index) can be much higher than the actual temperature.
- Cold air holds less moisture, so the same absolute humidity can mean higher relative humidity in winter.
- Coastal and lake areas often have higher humidity than inland regions.
